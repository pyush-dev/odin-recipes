    <h1>Idli</h1>
        <img src="IdliPic.webp" alt="Description of the image">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Idli is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented de-husked black lentils and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolised by the body.</p>
        <p2>There are several regional variations of idlis made in South India and Sri Lanka. With the emigration of south Indians and Sri Lankans throughout the region and world, many variations on idli have been created in addition to the almost countless local variations. Hard-to-get ingredients and differing cooking customs have required changes in both ingredients and methods. Parboiled rice can reduce the soaking time considerably. Store-bought ground rice or cream of rice may also be used. Similarly, semolina or cream of wheat may be used for preparing rava idli (wheat idli). Dahi (yogurt) may be added to provide the sour flavour for unfermented batters. Pre-packaged mixes allow for almost instant idlis.</p2>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and chana dal and saute for a few seconds. Add curry leaves, dried red chile, cashews, ginger, green chile peppers, and hing and saute until cashew nuts turn slightly brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add semolina and cook and stir over low heat until slightly browned; remove mixture to a plate and let cool completely, about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add yogurt and carrot to the mixture and mix well. Add water as needed to reach desired consistency. Season with salt to taste. Cover and let sit for 15 minutes. Check batter consistency again; add more water if needed.</li>
                <li>Grease an idli pan and add water to steam; bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, add fruit salt to the batter, mix well, and then pour the batter in the greased molds.</li>
                <li>Steam the idli for 10 minutes. Remove the idli from the molds and serve.</li>
